Airg provides a Universal Wallet to all recipients of badges, certificates, ID cards that are published on the blockchain.  This Universal Wallet acts as a Passport for students to allow them to share their credentials anywhere in the world.  They are able to prove that they have earned these credentials and that the credentials can be verified on the blockchain.  Recipients control their data and their credentials but can share it with employers, recruiters or anyone that they chose to share with.

Airg allows verified Publishers to easily create and publish credentials on the blockchain.  These credentials utilize multi-signature and cryptographic algorithms to verify without a doubt who the issuer of the credentials are, the recipients of the credentials, and the details about the credentials itself.

Institutions and employers can solve “Fake diplomas” problem and promote Lifelong Learn with verified certificates anywhere in the world on the blockchain.
